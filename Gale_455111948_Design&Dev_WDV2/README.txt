Issues:



database needs to be expanded to include projects, location for them to sit within website needs to be laid out.


need to hide nav items for unidentified users and users that should not access parts of the site eg. register user for admin only 
(requires scripting with ajax looking at $_session)

code for using sessions div message not displaying, unable to fix

Check week 9 and connect for ajax code examples in use.??? no example found

put bootStrap on pages for a better interface, but worry about the pratical first

Have a Get user information for admins, without passwords, can use example code from database assignment to check what is needed to achive this.
