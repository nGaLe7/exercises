Requirements

  PART A - FILE STRUCTURE

2: Folder structure to contain view: html, css, js, images

3: README.TXT that outlines deployment issues

  PART D - HOSTED VERSION CONTROL

9: Code commits (ten) made to a version control system       <--- perform outside of tafe



Issues:


need to hide nav items for unidentified users and users that should not access parts of the site eg. register user for admin only 
(requires scripting with ajax looking at $_session)

Check week 9 and connect for ajax code examples in use.

put bootStrap on pages for a better interface, but worry about the pratical first

Have a Get user information for admins, without passwords, can use example code from database assignment to check what is needed to achive this.
